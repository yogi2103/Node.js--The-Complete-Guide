UUID:-
//http://localhost:8000/files/232342jdfdf-23234343sdwed-21323ds
Our downlaoad page have url something like above and the last part is uuid and suppose if I've made it simple
//http://localhost:8000/files/1
//http://localhost:8000/files/2
then one can easily download other files also which are uploaded by someone else.
So it's best for confidential part.

Api For testing of download page:
http://localhost:8000/files/d29c48f9-4b28-4400-a2f9-a072a6a1fbfc
